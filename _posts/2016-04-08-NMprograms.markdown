**Numerical Methods Programs using Octave** by Pritika Malhotra

Today, we had discussion on Numerical Methods using Octave programming.

The first method discussed was Bisection method and suggestions were provided which are listed later in the report. Then one by one others others methods were shown.

To add Functions folder, addpath method was used. To avoid it, alternative of copying function file or user creating symbolic link was suggested. There should be a fixed function file which user can use or edit the function, if required.

**Questions:**

1. **Can one run program without octave through executable?**

Executable can be run directly without compilation but will require Octave to be installed.
      
Executable Octave programs:

2. **What is the relevance of texinfo in the function file?**

Texinfo uses a single source file to produce output in a number of formats, both online and printed (dvi, html, info, pdf, xml, etc.). This means that instead of writing different documents for online information and another for a printed manual, you need write only one document. And when the work is revised, you need revise only that one document.

Then Sir assigned the task of running these programs in vpl and even trying the plots on vpl to Shweta.

**Suggestions given by Sir:**

To add plot between iteration and roots.

1. Make user friendly comments so that user knows how to define everything.

2. Supply default value to variables i.e. either he can use default value or he can chose to input values.

3. Proper variables names to be defined and standard style to be followed.

4. Give reference of book for algorithm followed (and provide record of everything so that one can compare.)

5. Keep input in entirely separate file (with minimum related info, instruction should be given).

6. Follow styling guidelines and beautify the program.

7. User should not addpath every time. Rather user should be given instruction to copy a particular function file to the specified folder of that method.

8. Statements common to all files should be kept in a single file and it should be included.

He said to rewrite the programs again by incorporating all of the above changes and provide relevant documentation or instructions so that any user can use these programs directly.
